* sbcl-builder
A project to build specified versions of SBCL with custom options.

The idea is to build a specific SBCL in this project, store the artifacts in github releases, then pull those artifacts into other CI jobs.

This saves a significant amount of time for other CI jobs because a custom SBCL only has to be built once instead of every CI run.
